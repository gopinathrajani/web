          <p>Authorities have identified the man suspected of shooting the son of a federal judge and wounding her husband last night in northern New Jersey. The suspect was named as Roy Den Hollander, a lawyer and activist in the so-called men's rights movement. Police say Den Hollander was found dead. As NPR's Brian Mann reports, the shooting at the judge's home is still being investigated.

BRIAN MANN, BYLINE: The FBI says Roy Den Hollander went to the family home of Judge Esther Salas on Sunday. It's believed he was dressed as a delivery driver. At a briefing today, New Jersey Gov.PHIL MURPHY: Whose son was murdered and husband seriously wounded yesterday in a brazen and cowardly act of gun violence at their home. This is an unconscionable tragedy.

MANN: Salas herself was uninjured. After a massive manhunt, state police in New York told NPR they had found a body in Rockland, N.Y., which they believed was linked to the case.
